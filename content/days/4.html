    Over the last few years, you've helped us identify almost 2 million images on Snapshot Serengeti. Recently the first 1.2 million of those were made available to researchers wordlwide. But along the way, a few thousand photos fell through the cracks for one reason or another. We have recovered them, and now we present to you a new brand new season of Snapshot Serengeti - The Lost Season! Start indentifying the animals in the never-berfore-seen pictures right now at <a href="http://www.snapshotserengeti.org/">www.snapshotserengeti.org</a>.
