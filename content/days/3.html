    What a treat we have for you behind door number 3 of the advent calendar! Not one, but two entirely new versions of Old Weather. The first is a complete revamp of the original Old Weather project, and the second is a fresh new project looking at historical logs from whaling vessels operating in treacherous Arctic waters. Check them both out right now at <a href="http://www.oldweather.org/">www.oldweather.org</a> and <a href="http://whaling.oldweather.org/">whaling.oldweather.org</a>.
