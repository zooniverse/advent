Following on from yesterday's post about alternative project titles, specifically the one for Floating Forests, I thought I would share the brilliant effort of the research team to alter the lyrics of Help! by the Beatles to fit their project. You can read them in <a href="http://blog.floatingforests.org/2014/08/13/the-beatles-on-kelp-and-citizen-science/">this blog post</a>.

PS: If you fancy actually having a go at recording the song, please send it to me!!!
