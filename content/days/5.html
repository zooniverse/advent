  <p>
    Today's advent gift is a personal thank you from myself (Grant Miller, Zooniverse Communications Lead) for all the effort you have put in this year. View the video (shot on location in France!) <a href="http://daily.zooniverse.org/2015/12/05/zooniverse-advent-day-5-a-thank-you-from-grant/">here<a/>.

    PS: See if you can spot my deliberate numerical mistake. I think we have slightly more volunteers than I said...
